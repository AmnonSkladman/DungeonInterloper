# DungeonInterloper
This is a classic, text-based dungeon crawler, similar to the retro RPGs from the past. It's mostly a way for me to learn Python and get better at it, but also a fun game, too.

# Story
You awake in a dungeon, no memory of how you got there. The last thing you do remember, though, was that you were on a flight going somewhere. Now, you're trying to piece everything together and make your way back home to your loved ones.

# Mechanics

## Random Number Generator
There are RNGs being used to determine outcomes, such as die rolls. These will ensure that the game will usually play out differently every time.

## If Statements
These are to determine logic in the game and make the appropriate decisions and advancements. These are also in place to hopefully prevent any bugs or crashes.

## ANSI Escape Codes

- Black: \u001b[30m
