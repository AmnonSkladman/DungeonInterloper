# DungeonInterloper
This is a classic, text-based dungeon crawler, similar to the retro RPGs from the past. It's mostly a way for me to learn Python and get better at it, but also a fun game, too.

# Story
You awake in a dungeon, no memory of how you got there. The last thing you do remember, though, was that you were on a flight going somewhere. Now, you're trying to piece everything together and make your way back home to your loved ones.

# Mechanics
## Random Number Generator
## Random String Picker
## If Statements
## Switch Statements
### And more...

# How To Play
It's a text-based game. Just read the prompts and answer the questions as they come up. Please make sure to type the answers as accurately as possible. Sometimes, possible ones are offered, such as "y" or "n". Other times, you just have to guess. For example, "go east" or "open box".

# How To Install
As of right now, I seriously have no idea. I will be updating this section (and the ones above) as I keep working on this project. Please feel free to help me!
