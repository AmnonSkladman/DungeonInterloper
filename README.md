# DungeonInterloper
This is a classic, text-based dungeon crawler, similar to the retro RPGs from the past. It's mostly a way for me to learn Python and get better at it, but also a fun game, too.

# Story
You awake in a dungeon, no memory of how you got there. The last thing you do remember, though, was that you were on a flight going somewhere. Now, you're trying to piece everything together and make your way back home to your loved ones.

# Mechanics
## Random Number Generator
There are RNGs being used to determine outcomes, such as die rolls. These will ensure that the game will usually play out differently every time.
## Random String Picker
NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
## If Statements
These are to determine logic in the game and make the appropriate decisions and advancements. These are also in place to hopefully prevent any bugs or crashes.
## Switch Statements
See above, "If Statements".
### And more...
YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED

# How To Play
It's a classic-style, text-based dungeon crawler game. Just read the prompts and answer the questions as they come up. Please make sure to type the answers as accurately as possible. Sometimes, possible ones are offered, such as "y" or "n". Other times, you just have to guess. For example, "go east" or "open box".
